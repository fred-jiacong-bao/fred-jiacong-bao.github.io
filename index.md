## About Me

Hi! I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Operations Management/Management Science at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland.

My research applies data-driven approaches to social impact areas including child labor, organ transplantation, and other sustainability and healthcare challenges. I primarily employ methods in empirical operations management.
